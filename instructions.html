    <h1>Rock • Paper • Scissors <span class="subtitle">Minus One — How to play</span></h1>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This is a two-hand variant of rock–paper–scissors. You choose <em>two</em> hands (Hand 1 and Hand 2). The computer secretly chooses two hands as well. After both sides pick, you must remove one hand (shout “minus one”) — the remaining single hand from each side is compared to decide the round.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step (quick)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>On the left, pick your <strong>Hand 1</strong> and <strong>Hand 2</strong> (each can be rock, paper, or scissors).</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Show hands</strong>. The computer’s two hands are revealed and your two hands are shown as buttons.</li>
      <li>Choose which of your two hands to keep by clicking the corresponding hand button (you have ~4.56 seconds).</li>
      <li>After you pick, the remaining computer hand is chosen (the site randomly picks one of the computer's two hands) and winner/tie is displayed.</li>
      <li>Score updates (Wins / Losses / Ties). Use <strong>Reset Score</strong> to clear.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Detailed rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rock beats Scissors; Paper beats Rock; Scissors beats Paper.</li>
      <li>If both final hands are the same, the round is a tie.</li>
      <li>If you fail to choose which hand to keep before the timer ends, you are disqualified for that round and the computer gains a win.</li>
      <li>If you don't click both Hand 1 and Hand 2 before pressing <em>Show hands</em>, an alert will prompt you to choose both hands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example 1</strong>: You pick <em>rock</em> and <em>paper</em>. Computer reveals <em>scissors</em> and <em>paper</em>.
      <ul>
        <li>If you keep <em>rock</em> → computer's selected final hand may be <em>scissors</em> or <em>paper</em>; rock loses to paper, beats scissors — result depends.</li>
        <li>If you keep <em>paper</em> → paper ties with paper or beats rock; in this example, if computer final is paper → tie, if scissors → you lose.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Controls & UI notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show hands</strong> — reveal both player's and computer's two hands and starts the 4.56s timer for you to pick.</li>
      <li>Click one of your two revealed hand buttons to keep it. That triggers the round resolution.</li>
      <li><strong>Reset Score</strong> — clears local storage and resets displayed wins/losses/ties.</li>
      <li>The computer chooses its final hand randomly between its two choices (50/50).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Q: What happens if I click only one hand then Show hands?</dt>
      <dd>A: The game alerts you to select both hands before proceeding.</dd>
      <dt>Q: Where is the rule “minus one” enforced?</dt>
      <dd>A: After Show hands, you must click which of your two hands you keep (effectively "minus one"). If you don't, the timer code penalizes you.</dd>

      Tip: try combinations of moves to learn how the computer's random final choice affects risk. This page was autogenerated from the game's rules and current site behaviour.
