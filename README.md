<h2> <b> Machine-Learning Enhanced Rock–Paper–Scissors Game </b> </h2>
<p>A browser-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game powered by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicts player behavior based on move patterns.</p>
<b>Machine Learning:</b><br>
Integrates a lightweight ML model, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built from scratch in JavaScript, allowing the computer to learn from the player's previous moves and predict the player's next move which the computer counters accordingly.<br>

Result is a gameplay experience where:
<ul>
  <li>the computer adapts over time</li>
  <li>repeatedly used strategies become less effectivee</li>
  <li>every round feels more competitive</li>
</ul>

 <b><h2>Features</b></h2> 
 <ul>
  <li>ML-powered predictions using a custom JavaScript RNN</li>
  <li>Adaptive difficulty, the model improves as you play</li>
  <li>LocalStorage persistence for move history and score</li>
  <li>Squid Game inspired game mechanics (rock paper scissors minus one)</li>
  <li>Replayable, unpredictable, and competitive</li>
</ul>

<h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>Minus-One Variant</p>
This game uses a twist:

-Player selects two hands.

-Computer also generates two hands

-On reveal, both sides must discard one hand.

-Final hand decides the winner.

An attempt to make a simple classic game feel new again :)
